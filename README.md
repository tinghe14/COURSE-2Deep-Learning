# COURSE-2Deep-Learning

This course foucus on:
- basic theoretical and methodological underpinnings of machine learning
- commonly used architecture for Deep Learning
- current challenges such as ethics and fairness
- specilized applications such as computer vision

Topics:
Basic formalism:
- multi-layer preceptrons
- convolutional neural networks
- sequence models (a little bit of NLP)
Advanced concepts:
- generative models including autoencoders and adversarial networks
- some reinforcement learning
- unsupervised and self-supervised learning
- challenges(generlization, bias, ethics, ...)
- applications in cv and medicine

# Assignment
